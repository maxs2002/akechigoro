<em>i do not like the idea of "fictionkin". why? people took away an aspect of psychosis, delusions, specifically delusions of being someone else, and gave it a name. a stupid sounding one, at that. i'm not going to get mad at you for self-identifying as fictionkin, because that would be stupid. i just personally despise the idea of someone acting like they have these delusions, especially after i, as well as many others across the globe, have been demonized for our disorder. you do not have to agree or respect this opinion to follow, but this is not up for debate.</em></p>
